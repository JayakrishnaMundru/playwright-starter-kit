# Playwright Starter Kit (TypeScript)

A practical Playwright + TypeScript starter workspace with a focus on maintainability:
- Stable locator strategy (`getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByTestId`)
- Clean test structure and reusability patterns
- CI-ready basics

## Quickstart
```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
npx playwright test
```

## Notes
This repo intentionally excludes any WFN/domain-specific content.
